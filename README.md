This project is still in development

# I3C_Library
This project is a collection of functions to work with I3C files easilly

It is intended to be a set of code that will help the development of other programs that uses 
3D images by regrouping all the common functions at the same place. This way, when this code 
will be updated, it should require minimal effort to apply the fixes to all the programs using
this library. 

This projects currently contains the code for rendering I3C images and code to read and write 
3D images. Work is currently being done to enable hybrid 3D rendering (OpenGL + I3C image rendering).

Some efforts are also put toward making a 3D video format.
